Project: Information Extraction from Website

Objective: Extract "IMPPAT phytochemical identifier" data from a table on the website's search results page, based on specific search criteria. Save the data in a CSV file.

Steps:

1.  Website Access and Navigation:
    *   Use the requests library to fetch the HTML content of the starting URL: https://cb.imsc.res.in/imppat/.
    *   Navigate to the search page: https://cb.imsc.res.in/imppat/basicsearch/phytochemical.
    *   Use the requests library to send a POST request to the search page with the following parameters:
        *   Search field: "Indian medicinal plant"
        *   Search for: "Camellia Sinensis"
        *   Filter for: "leaf"
2.  Data Extraction:
    *   Use BeautifulSoup4 or lxml to parse the HTML content of the search results page.
    *   Locate the HTML table containing the data.
    *   Iterate through the table rows and extract the data from the "IMPPAT phytochemical identifier" column.
3.  Data Storage:
    *   Use the csv module to write the extracted data to a CSV file.
    *   Define the header for the CSV file as "IMPPAT phytochemical identifier".
    *   Write each extracted identifier as a row in the CSV file.
4.  Error Handling:
    *   Implement error handling to gracefully handle potential issues, such as:
        *   Network errors (e.g., website unreachable).
        *   HTML parsing errors.
        *   Unexpected changes in the website structure.
5.  Code Structure and Implementation:
    *   Python script will be provided to perform the task.

Next Steps:

*   Create the python script.
*   Save the .csv file in the project root directory.
